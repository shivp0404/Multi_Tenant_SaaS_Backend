# 🏢 Multi-Tenant SaaS Backend

**💻 Node.js · 🐘 PostgreSQL**

A production-grade oriented, multi-tenant SaaS backend foundation where a single backend securely serves multiple organizations with strict tenant isolation, RBAC, and invitation-based onboarding.  

**✨ Architecture-first. Security-first. Feature-complete by design, not by accident.**

## 🔍 What This Demonstrates (Quick Scan)

- ✅ Correct multi-tenant modeling  
- 🔑 Permission-based RBAC (DB-driven)  
- ✉️ Invitation-based org membership  
- 🏷️ Tenant-scoped queries everywhere  
- 🔒 Stateless authentication  
- ❌ CRUD completeness (intentionally deferred)

---

## 🧠 Core Rule

**Authentication →** who you are  
**Authorization →** what you can do  
**Tenant ID →** where you can do it

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Auth (identity only)
↓
Tenants (organizations)
↓
Memberships (user_tenants)
↓
Roles → Permissions (RBAC)
↓
Business Services (Tasks)


---

## 🔐 Authentication

- 🔑 JWT-based authentication  
- ⏱️ Short-lived access tokens + refresh tokens  
- 🔒 Secure password hashing  

**Token payload:**

{ "userId": "<uuid>" }
🚫 No tenant, role, or permission data in tokens
✔ All authorization decisions are database-driven

## 🏢 Tenants & Memberships
👥 Users can belong to multiple organizations

✉️ Invitation-based onboarding

Membership lifecycle: invited → active → rejected

Core tables: tenants, user_tenants, roles

## 🛂 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
🌐 Permissions are global

🏢 Roles are tenant-scoped

✅ Code checks permissions, never roles

Middleware: can("task.create")

✔ Immediate permission revocation
✔ No hard-coded authorization logic


## Guarantees:

🏷️ Tenant isolation enforced at query level

🔑 RBAC enforced on every request

🆔 UUID primary keys

⚠ Task update is intentionally deferred (see Scope)

## 🗂 Project Structure
```
 src/
 ├─ modules/
 │   ├─ auth/
 │   ├─ tenant/
 │   ├─ business/
 ├─ middlewares/
 ├─ utils/
 └─ routers/  

```
 Structure convention: routes → controllers → services → repositories → queries

Designed for ✅ testability and ✅ extension.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
🧪 Integration tests: Supertest + real DB

🧩 Unit tests: service layer (repositories mocked)

🔑 RBAC validated via real HTTP flows

Scope decision: Tenant & Membership flows are integration-tested.
Business (Tasks) integration tests are not duplicated, as they reuse the same authorization and tenant-scoping logic.
This is a deliberate engineering tradeoff.

### 📌 Scope & Non-Goals (Current Phase)
✏️ Task update API

🧪 Duplicate integration tests for structurally identical services

Focus is on multi-tenant safety, RBAC correctness, and authorization guarantees, not CRUD completeness.
These features can be added without architectural changes.

## 🛡 Security Guarantees

🏷️ Tenant-scoped queries everywhere

❌ No hard-coded roles

🔑 Immediate permission revocation

👥 Multi-organization users supported

🔒 Stateless backend (no server-side active tenant)

## 🚀 Status
✅ Core architecture complete

✅ Multi-tenant isolation enforced

✅ RBAC implemented and verified

✅ Ready for production-level extension

## 🧠 Final Note

This repository represents a production-grade SaaS backend foundation, intentionally scoped to validate architectural correctness before feature expansion.
